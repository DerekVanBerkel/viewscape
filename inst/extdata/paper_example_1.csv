The second one made up some bogus crap about not taking pictures of university buildings from university property. That seems ridiculous to me. They let me finish shooting as long as I didn't hang around after that. Whatever coppers.

Anyway, this is probably the longest pano I've ever taken. It took a LONG time to assemble in autostitch but twas totally worth it. Yes? No? ","Attribution-NonCommercial License","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/"

“A trail made of pine needles and thistles leads you into the green darkness. 

The canopy casts shadows on old oaks and dogwoods, and you think you can smell the sour breath of a witch behind you. 

The wind sighs like a sleeping girl, carrying her bittersweet dreams along the paths to attract any man willing to look for thorn-covered castles. 

A wolf darts between fallen, rotted wood; maybe he’s the one who can tell you where your heart is, how you’re still breathing.”
